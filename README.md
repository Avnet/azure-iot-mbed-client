# Overview
This code provides an example implementation of an Azure IoT Client using a Cellular data connection.  The code follows the style and content of the othere examples Microsoft provides (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-get-started-physical) but is taliored to use the [ARM Mbed OS](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os) (currently at v5.x) and the [ARM Easy-Connect](https://github.com/ARMmbed/easy-connect) framework. 

Generally speaking, there are two steps necessary to exercise this example code:
1. Setting up and configuring an Azure IoT Hub
2. Creating the IoT Client code and running it on the IoT End Device

This repository focues on step #2.  To learn more about step #1 refer to the Element14 blog post () or any of the [Microsoft examples](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-get-started-physical).

# Hardware Used
The hardware platform used for this project consists of:

* STM32 Nucleo-64 development board
* Motion MEMS and environmental sensor board
* Avnet RSR1157 NBIoT BG96 Expansion Board

## Note
  The code used to develop this example utilized the following STM32 Nucleo-L476RG and Quectel BG96 Module Firmware:
  
      * BG96 Modem SW Revision: BG96MAR02A04M1G
      * STM32 Version: 0221 / Build: Mar 16 2018 10:08:46


# Building the samples:
To build the Sample program, you must use the mbed command line tools (mbed CLI).

## On-line compiler
1. Navigate to the [on-line compiler](https://os.mbed.com/compiler)
2. Select the NUCLEO-L496ZG as the platform to be used
3. Select the ***'Import'*** button, then the ***'Click here'*** hyperlink to bring up the import dialog
4. Insert 'https://github.com/jflynn129/aws-iot-device-sdk-mbed-c' as the source dialog and select the ***Update all libraries to the latest revision*** check box. After performing those two steps, select the ***'Import'*** button to import the project into you on-line workspace

The program is now loaded into your on-line workspace, by default, if you press the ***'Compile'*** button, the program is built. Once compiled,  the executable binary file will be placed into your computers 'Downloads' folder so you can copy it to your STM32 board.


# Next steps
After Youâ€™ve run this sample application, collected sensor data, and interacted with your IoT hub, you may want to exercise some of the other Azure IoT scenarios.  See the following tutorials:
